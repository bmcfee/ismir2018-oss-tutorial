Hello & welcome to Part 3!  This is where we'll start to use the various things you've installed to work with the code.

## Get the Code

We're going to go over some real-world basics of how git works and how conda works.
We'll do this by getting you a copy of the code we're going to work with on to your local machine, then installing the packages we need with conda.

Visit `https://github.com/bmcfee/ismir2018-oss-tutorial`, and press the **Fork** button.  You'll be asked where to fork the code to – select your own GitHub username.  A "fork" is your own copy of our code.  You can change it without altering our code.

Now, visit `https://github.com/<your-username>/ismir2018-oss-tutorial`, and press the **Clone** button.  Make sure to select **Clone with SSH**, and then copy the string that looks like `git@github:<your-username>/ismir2018-oss-tutorial.git`

Then, in your terminal, go to wherever you keep your code, and do `git clone <that string>`.  This will do a lot of stuff!  Once it is done, you should see a directory called `ismir2018-oss-tutorial`.  

`cd` into that directory, then do `ls`.  You should see the same files that you see on GitHub!

#### Checkpoint

From the `ismir2018-oss-tutorial` directory, run:
{% highlight bash %}
git status
{% endhighlight %}

You should see:
{% highlight bash %}
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
nothing to commit, working directory clean
{% endhighlight %}


## Install Things with Conda

Conda, like we said earlier, is both a package manager and an environment manager.  A package manager just installs things for you.  An environment manager is a bit more complex – it keeps track of different independent environments, each of which can have different things installed.  So, for example, you can have one environment for this project and install the things that you need ... and then have a different environment for a different project, with different packages installed!

This may sound like overkill, but it is very helpful in the long run.  You'll often find that different projects have clashing requirements, and maintaining one environment per project will prevent this from getting out of hand.

So, let's make one and install the code that we need!  To create an environment for this tutorial, do  `conda create --name ismir-2018`.  You'll see that environment has been created at `/Users/<your-user>/miniconda3/envs/ismir-2018-tutorial`!  Hooray!  To turn it on do `conda activate ismir-2018-tutorial`.

This means that any Python code you install with conda or pip will only be installed in this environment.  If you want to get out of this environment, just run `source deactivate` – but don't run it now!

For now, we're going to install all the stuff we need.  Run `conda install --file requirements.txt`.  Lots of things should happen!

#### Checkpoint

Run:
{% highlight bash %}
conda list
{% endhighlight %}

You should see something like the below:
{% highlight bash %}
packages in environment at /Users/thorkell/miniconda3:

 Name                    Version                   Build

### Secret Bonus Checkpoint!

Just when you thought you had done all the checkpoints!

We want to stop here quickly and make sure of everything, so we wrote a little test script that makes sure that everything is installed.
In the `scripts` folder, you'll find a file called `test_tutorial_install.sh`.  

Run:
{% highlight bash %}
./scripts/test_tutorial_install.sh
{% endhighlight %}

You should see:
{% highlight bash %}
Checking git and conda
git version 2.7.4
conda 4.5.11
Checking Python version
Python 3.6.5 :: Anaconda, Inc.
Checking Python packages ...
Success! Everything appears to be installed!
{% endhighlight %}

## Run the Tests

So we've installed all the packages we'll need.  Let's run the tests.  Tests make sure that your code is doing what your think it is doing – making sure that 2 + 2 in fact comes out to 4.

You can find the test code in the `tests/` folder, and we'll talk more about testing later in the tutorial.  For now, just run the tests with `pytest`.

💥🔥💥🔥💥🔥💥🔥💥🔥💥 _OH NO EVERYTHING FAILED!_ 💥🔥💥🔥💥🔥💥🔥💥🔥💥

Phew, ok, this is not actually a big deal at all.  Failing tests are usually a good sign, becaue they mean that your tests found a bug or a problem.  Let's look at the error message that pytest is showing, and see if we can fix it.

Ah, this does not look so bad.  We're missing a package called `pandas`.  We could just install it with conda, but we want to fix this problem for the long term.  So, open up that requirements.txt file, and add the line `pandas` at the bottom, and the save it.  Then re-run `conda install --file requirements.txt`, and then run the tests again.

#### Checkpoint

Run:
{% highlight bash %}
pytest
{% endhighlight %}

You should see:
{% highlight bash %}
platform darwin -- Python 3.6.5, pytest-3.7.2, py-1.5.4, pluggy-0.7.1

{% endhighlight %}


## Save Our Work

We fixed a bug, hooray!  But we've only fixed our local version.  Let's commit this to our local git repository, and then update the version on GitHub.

First, make a new branch to work on. Working in a branch means that we can do whatever we want without breaking our main code.  Do `git checkout -b update-conda-env`.

Next, add and commit your files:  `git add requirements.txt`, then `git commit -m "Add pandas to requirements.txt"`

Rad!  We've saved our work locally.  To push your code to GitHub, do `git push origin update-conda-env`.

We want to get in the habit of keeping our online work up to date with our local work.  So let's go look at GitHub, and merge this branch there.
- Visit GitHub, and find your fork of this repository:  https://github.com/<your-github-username>/ismir2018-oss-tutorial/branches
- You'll see a list of branches - select **update-conda-env**.
- You'll see a small button that says **New pull request**.  Press it!
- This will take you to a nice web form.  Put in the reasons for your changes, and press **Create Pull Request**.

Hooray, you've made a Pull Request!  Pull Requests (PRs) are the best way to contribute code to a project.  You can review & comment on the proposed changes before merging them, or request that things be improved.

🙏 Here's an important aside:  when discussing code in PRs, please be nice!  It's really easy for a neutral comment to be read as mean, and it's really easy to alienate people by being mean  You should do your best to very polite and kind when dealing with people on GitHub (and probably on computers in general). 

With that said, let's merge our PR!  This will add the changes from your branch to the `master` branch.
- Press **Merge**.  GitHub will merge your commit into master.  
- Now your online repo is up to date, so let's update your local.
- In your command line, run `git checkout master`.
- Next, do `git pull origin master` to update your local copy.  You'll see that git adds your commit from GitHub to your local copy.
- Finally, do `git branch -d update-conda-env` to delete your local branch – you've merged the commits to master, so you can delete it.

#### Checkpoint

Run:
{% highlight bash %}
git log
{% endhighlight %}

You should see something like this:
{% highlight bash %}
commit fc48577568d259f361a2e5f28267500ff2d4405f
Author: <Your Name> <your-email@your-server>
Date:   <today>

Add pandas to requirements.txt
{% endhighlight %}

We've just gone over the basic git and GitHub workflow that you should, in general, stick with: make a branch, make some changes, run tests, commit, push, merge, clean up.

This means that you never have untested code in master, and it means that master is always functional.  This is called "Continuous Integration", or "Continuous Delivery".  There are whole books about why this is a good idea, but you can read [a good summary of the GitHub version of it here][github-flow].

It also means that the online, "deployed" version of master is your primary version, and you just have a local version that you're working on.

## Success!

We've used git to check out code, modify it, and commit our modifications.  We've also used conda to install the code we need, in an environment that is specific to this project.  In [Part 4][tutorial-part-4], we'll get into the details of our Python code and how it all fits together.
